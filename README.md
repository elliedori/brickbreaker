# Brickbreaker

Re-creating the beloved Blackberry game in pure JS. 

## Current implementation

  * Score keeping
  * Single level game
  * 3 lives at start of game
  * Standard collision detection
  * All bricks break on first contact
  * Paddle is responsive to arrow keys as well as mouse movement

## Future changes
  * Add tests
  * Add higher levels
  * Refactor into MVC pattern
  * Add secret keyboard shortcuts
  * Implement variable bricks, some that break only after being hit twice
  * Update collision algorithm to change ball speed when it hits the paddle
